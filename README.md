# ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection

This repository contains a jupyter notebook for a kaggle challenge.

I've used simple logistic regression to see what is possible for fraud detection.


## ðŸ”Ž Usage

Download the repository and inspect the jupyter notebook. In addition, you can simply look at the jupyter notebook via GitHub.

For usage, you need to find out your kaggle username and api key. Those two things are in your kaggle.json file. Simply paste both inside the jupyter notebook.
